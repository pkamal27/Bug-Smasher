Game Description:
It is a virtual game for the Android Operating System. In this game we try to tap every ant we see on the screen. We try to squish them all before they reach the foodbar. The player has three lives indicated by three hearts at the top of the screen. Each time an ant reaches the foodbar the player loses one life. The bigger and stronger ants will need multiple tapping to kill them. If you do not manage to kill the bigger ones, its game over. The more ants you squish the more points you collect and the highest score is recorded.

Getting started:
Download all the files to your system that is in the repository. Make sure Android Studio is installed in your system and Android 4.4 (kitkat) is selected as the target SDK version. I have run my simulation on the Galaxy Nexus API 19 device.
